# Session Helper

The Session Helper works exactly the same way as the Session Component, the only difference is the Session Helper is available in your views.

```php
$value =  $this->Session->read('monster');
$this->Session->write('montster','drink');
$this->Session->delete('monster');
```

For more information see the [Session Component Guide](/docs/controller/session-component).
